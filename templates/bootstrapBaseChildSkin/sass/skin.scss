// imported-skin-properties imports variables from skin.properties.

@import 'skin.properties';

// skin-properties-mapping maps skin.properties values to Bootstrap.
// See the file for the variables that are set.
//@import 'skin-properties-mapping';

// default-variables sets the default variables for the vendor libraries.  These
// values are set with the !default and will not replace identical variable set
// before or after these files.
@import 'vendor/default-variables';

// skin-properties-extensions override variables from included libraries or set
// new variables which will be used throughout Sass.

// vendor - external libraries. These files should not be modified so that
// updates can be drop-in replacements. Any overrides or extensions of these
// belong in the /lithium directory.
//
//
// only 1 of the two following includes should be uncommented.
//
// vendor/includes-full includes all Bootstrap files along with their classes
// including components that are not currently used by the current skin.
// note: bootstrap.js is not included by default in either of the libraries and
// may be required for some components to function.
// CAUTION: using includes-full more than doubles the size of the final CSS!
//
// vendor/includes-min includes only Boostrap components which are used by
// the base skin. Bootstrap classes are included as placeholders
// http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#placeholder_selectors_
// and are not included in the final CSS to keep the filesize smaller.
//@import 'vendor/includes-full';

// import Bootstrap libraries here after Bootstrap but before Lithium.
// This location provides the ability to alter vendor files or add libraries
// which lithium then extends, inheriting the altered files.

 

// lia-responsive-base are the Lithium Sass files that both extend the vendor
// libraries as well as provide mixins and CSS for the rest of the components.
// ** FUTURE - does not exist yet  _lia-mobile-base.scss           mobile only set of scss.  Iâ€™m torn between making this a configuration vs different includes.
// ** FUTURE - does not exist yet  _lia-mobile-tablet-base.scss    mobile and tablet scss.  As these files diverge from desktop / responsive, a config may be messier in the long run than splitting the files now.
